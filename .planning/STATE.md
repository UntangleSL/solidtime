# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-19)

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Tenant Setup & Outlook Spike

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-19 — Roadmap created (7 phases, 39/39 v1 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Graph sync backend and calendar ghost UI merged into one vertical phase (Phase 3), compressing research's 8 suggested phases to 7
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (recurring rules) and Phase 6 (out-of-sync) depend only on Phase 4 and can run in parallel
- [Roadmap]: Deletion cleanup (SEC-03) and the off switch (OPS-02) are verified end-to-end in Phase 7; each earlier phase adds cascading FKs and the "integration configured" gate as it goes
- [Roadmap]: Dokploy env config and docs (OPS-01) land in Phase 2 so the HTTPS redirect URI behind Traefik is proven early
- [Roadmap]: All phases run in MVP mode (goals written as user stories)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Blocked on the Untangle M365 admin: app registration, admin consent, assignment-required group, client-secret handover, Conditional Access check, and a test mailbox with sample meetings
- [Phase 1]: Series identity, cancelled/moved representation and immutable-id stability stay unknown until real fixtures exist; the findings may change the Phase 3-6 schema
- [Phase 2]: SocialiteProviders on Laravel 13 and Socialite under Octane need a smoke test before building on them
